# Streetlights

To have the better management of the city, working of the street light is of prime concern. So to have the detecion I have trained a yolov5 model.

To train the model for day time frames and night time frames you need to run the yolov5NightStreetLight.ipynb and collected the map score.

The day time dataset is present in the [Link](https://iiitaphyd.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/Mobility-Mobility-RA/Shared%20Documents/Mobility%20-RA/Amandeep%20Kumar/Amandeep/day_frames?csf=1&web=1&e=19V2RD). The dataset contains today of 1233 images, were I took the 70% of images for training, 10% for validation and 20% testing. The trained model is present in the [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XQ7Ll1aX2Jrww7DdNFFSdNPH_FPyqcAP).

The night time dataset is present in the [Link](https://iiitaphyd.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/Mobility-Mobility-RA/Shared%20Documents/Mobility%20-RA/Amandeep%20Kumar/Amandeep/night_frames?csf=1&web=1&e=wHWDRg). The dataset contains today of 1175 images annotated street lights, were I took the 70% of images for training, 10% for validation and 20% testing. The trained model is present in the [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XQ7Ll1aX2Jrww7DdNFFSdNPH_FPyqcAP).

Dataset for side view is present in the [Link](https://iiitaphyd.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/Mobility-Mobility-RA/Shared%20Documents/Mobility%20-RA/Amandeep%20Kumar/Amandeep/side_view?csf=1&web=1&e=FArfgJ).
